| Create a separate class each in a .java file to represent a blood collection center, a donor, a blood donation.                                                                   |  A method to restore the saved content back into an appropriate Java data structure for the next run time         | Create GUI (Graphical User Interface) application.                                                                |
| The blood collection center has a name and a list of eligible donors.                                                                                                             | A method to save the content of the created Java structure into a text file.                                     | Design window by using a minimum of four different user interface controls labels, text field, buttons, text area |
|  Each donor has a name, blood type , contact number and also has a single list to keep track of all they blood donations‚Äô types at specific dates. Initially the list is empty. | create an Exceptions which are basically derived classes of Exception and class that defines a duplicate exception. | Exceptions which are basically derived classes of Exception. Write a class that defines a duplicate exception     |
